# website-review-tool
A tool that can review a defined range of UoM websites (internal and external), and detect thing like broken links and specified text or other user defined content, and return results which highlight hits and link to impacted pages to facilitate repair and update (currently, we need to eyeball webpages and click hundreds of links to check this – given structure of UoM websites this makes keeping webisted up to date virtually impossible). As an extension, if the tool could do the same for documents stored in a SharePoint site, that would be super ace.
